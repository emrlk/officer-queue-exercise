# officer-queue-exercise
An exercise that utilizes a linked queue to traverse a text file and mimic a fictional scenario, as described in README.

"During the Civil War, a group of Confederate officers are in a clandestine meeting when they 
suddenly discover they are surrounded by an overwhelming Union force. There is absolutely 
no hope for victory without reinforcements, and Stonewall Jackson's horse, Little Sorrel, is the 
only horse available that can be used to escape and summon help. The officers agree to a pact 
to determine which of them is to go for help.
The officers form a queue and they pick a number from a hat. Beginning with the first officer 
in the queue, they begin to count. As each officer counts off, he moves to the end of the 
queue. When the count reaches the number that was picked, that officer is removed from the 
queue, and the count begins again with the next man. Once an officer is removed from the 
queue, he is no longer counted. The last officer that remains in the queue is the one that rides 
away on Little Sorrel to summon help."
